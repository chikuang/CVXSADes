# exact-design-SA
Construct exact design using CVX with conjuction to simulated annealing


### TODO

- [ ] Using an approximate design from CVX and N=21 for the discrete design space $S_N$, construct $n=20$ exact D-optimal design points in [-1, 1] via an annealing algorithm
- [ ] Using an approximate design from CVX and N=21 for the discrete design space $S_N$, construct $n=18$ exact D-optimal design points in [-1, 1] via an annealing algorithm.
- [ ] Using an approximate design from CVX and N=51 for the discrete design space $S_N$, construct $n=20$ exact D-optimal design points in [-1, 1] via an annealing algorithm.
