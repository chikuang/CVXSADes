### Description

Implementation of finding the optimal exact regression designs with complex settings using CVX in conjunction with the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The applications include 1) high-dimensional design, 2) Maximin design with competing optimal criteria, and 3) integer design problems.

### Computing Environment

Windows Machine with an i9 processor equipped with MATLAB 2023 version B update 2 and CVX version 2.2.

### Applications

1. Two-variables logistic regression model with interaction.
2. Seven-dimensional logistic regression model with some interactions.
3. Group design for disease prevalence
4. Maximin design with three competing design criteria.
